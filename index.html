            Context: For this project, we were give 70mins to design and test a voting machine. 
            1. My team and I began by making list of all the design requirment.
            2. We looked existing machine designed for mono-purpose such as voting machine, ATM machine, and store scanner. We highligted elements we liked and want to include in our design.
            3. We sketched out our ideas of what the prototype should look like.
            4. Once we agreed on the design, we split tasks among the group memebers and began putting the parts together.
            5. We then we conducted usability testing.
